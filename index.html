            A decentralized humanitarian framework offering a peaceful, ethical, and open-source model for local and global cooperation. Together, we build trust, foster resilience, and align without control.

  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About SOUL</h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The Society of Unified Life (SOUL) was created in response to a growing global awareness: that humanity is approaching a point of irreversible fragmentation and collapse—culturally, ecologically, and ethically. We face accelerating technologies, eroding trust, and systems that no longer serve the people they claim to protect.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      SOUL offers a peaceful alternative. It is not a movement to seize power—it is a framework to rebuild trust. We do not ask for loyalty, belief, or ideology. We offer tools, values, and structure to help ordinary people quietly restore their communities through transparency, cooperation, and mutual care.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      SOUL is not a political party. Not a religion. Not a cult. It is a living, decentralized structure that anyone can use—without permission—to organize local action, mediate conflict, share skills, and model ethical leadership. It is built for those who are tired of division and ready to align.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The framework is scalable and modular. Whether you're helping one neighbor or starting a chapter, you are part of the whole. Each node functions independently, but carries the same DNA: 
      <strong className="block mt-4">Transparency over secrecy.</strong>
      <strong>Generosity over greed.</strong>
      <strong>Cooperation over control.</strong>
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      SOUL belongs to no one. And it is available to everyone. If you're ready to build something better—start here.

      {/* How It Works */}
      <section id="how" className="py-24 px-6 bg-[url('/parallax2.jpg')] bg-fixed bg-cover bg-center text-white">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto bg-black bg-opacity-70 p-8 rounded">
    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">How It Works</h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      SOUL begins with a mindset: that real change starts with self-awareness, compassion, and daily acts of alignment. You don’t need to join a chapter to be part of SOUL. If you live with intention, care for your community, and choose cooperation over conflict, you are already carrying the flame.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      From there, some choose to take the next step—connecting with others, forming local chapters known as <strong>SOUL Nodes</strong>. These groups host service missions, reflection circles, skill-sharing workshops, and community events. They operate autonomously but uphold shared values of transparency, generosity, and nonviolence.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      When multiple nodes choose to collaborate, they form a <strong>SOUL Constellation</strong>: a regional alliance that shares resources, mentors new chapters, and coordinates larger-scale efforts like festivals, cleanups, or workshops.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Above all sits the <strong>SOUL Nexus</strong>—not a governing body, but a living library. It preserves tools, principles, and wisdom gathered from across the network. It helps new nodes form, old ones adapt, and distant chapters stay connected without central control.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Supporting this entire system is the <strong>SOUL Foundation</strong>—a nonprofit layer that handles legal and financial infrastructure without interfering in cultural autonomy. It ensures the tools stay open-source, safe, and evolving.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      Whether you're showing up for a neighbor or helping launch a continent-wide campaign, SOUL reminds us that every small act of clarity, kindness, and cooperation creates ripples that cross generations. Start with yourself. Align with others. Let the example grow.
    </p>

  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">Get Involved</h2>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Getting involved with SOUL doesn’t require permission, status, or prior experience. Whether you’re cleaning up a park, joining a discussion, or just sharing wisdom with your neighbors—you’re already living the mission. This is a movement of people, not power.
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Here are just a few ways you can participate:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-lg space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Join the Discord</strong> – Learn, connect, share, and help shape direction through open discussion.</li>
      <li><strong>Subscribe on YouTube</strong> – Watch content, reflect on ideas, and contribute through polls and comments.</li>
      <li><strong>Support on Patreon</strong> – If you have extra to spare and truly want to help this grow, your support funds infrastructure and outreach (never personal luxury).</li>
      <li><strong>Participate in polls</strong> – Help decide what tools, topics, and actions get built next—through Discord, Patreon, and YouTube.</li>
      <li><strong>Start a chapter (Node)</strong> – Use a free starter kit to create local impact, and share what you learn back with the Nexus.</li>
      <li><strong>Share your experience</strong> – Every thoughtful act, success story, or failure adds wisdom to the shared framework.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-6">
      This is a decentralized, open-source project for humanity—shaped by the people who show up. No contribution is too small. If you’re willing to live with clarity and compassion, you’re already part of SOUL.

            SOUL is committed to radical financial transparency. Every dollar received is tracked and explained—from founder support to local action kits. We do not offer power in exchange for donations, and we cap compensation to ensure integrity.
